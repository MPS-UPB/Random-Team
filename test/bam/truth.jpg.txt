reasons which inﬂuence me to this step,
are the same which have been announced
hy others who have taken the sums course,
I have long fcnrcd that Frcetnasonry had
a strong tendency to Deism. Even in the
prescribed forms of prayer, we rarely find
any recognition ofthc .‘?«avionr. lt is not
an nns\'.'el' to this objection to gay,tl1attliis
institution existed before the H1l1tllfl'5iEtll0l1

to challenge for masonry :1 great anthnzity

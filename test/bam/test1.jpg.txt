Is it legal for voters to cast ballots’ in one

Alabama voters have been doing _]l1Sl
that for years without anyone saying they
couldnt. '

Since there is no party registration in
the state. voters are free to choose which
primary they wish to participate in. But
there is a state law that says voters may
vote in one primary “and no other.”

On the key mue of cromiver voting.
Hamilton said the subcommittee. if it does
not reiect the contest. must consider -
regardless of any evidence « that the
rule banning crossover voting has not
been enforced in the past.

To enforce it now would appear to be
selective enforcement, which the courts
could frown on if Graddick appealed an
unfavorable ruling from the subcommit-
tee. Hamilton said

‘The state party has never attempted
to i‘l7lUFC‘€ the rule. but now that the can-
didate they favor has lost they want to
enforce it.“ Hamilton said.

Party Chain nan John Baker vowed last
week that the panel is “predisposed to be
fair." He declined to answer questions
about Graddick‘s contention that the party

leadership favors Baxley. ‘
